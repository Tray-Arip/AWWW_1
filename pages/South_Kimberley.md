South Kimberley - What can it be?
===========================

**Kimberley** is the capital of the [Northern Cape](/wiki/Northern_Cape "Northern Cape") Province of [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"). Amongst other things, it is famous for its [Big Hole](/w/index.php?title=Big_Hole&action=edit&redlink=1 "Big Hole (page does not exist)"), the world's largest *hand-dug* excavation that was created when thousands of people searched for diamonds at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. By 14 August 1914, 22.7 billion kg of rock had been excavated, yielding 2722 kg of diamonds.

On 2 September 1882, Kimberley was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere and the second in the world after [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia"), [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania") in the [United States](/wiki/United_States_of_America "United States of America") to integrate [electric street lights](/wiki/Electric_street_lights "Electric street lights") into its infrastructure. The first stock exchange in Africa was built in Kimberley, as early as 1881.[[3]](#cite_note-3)
